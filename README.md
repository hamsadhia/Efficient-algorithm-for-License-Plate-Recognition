# Efficient-algorithm-for-License-Plate-Recognition
Since an autonomous information system has no meaning without any data, there is a need to reform vehicle information between reality and the information system.Among intelligent equipment, mention is made of the system of detection and recognition of the number plates of vehicles.The system of vehicle number plate detection and recognition is used to detect the plates then make the recognition of the plate that is to extract the text from an image and all that thanks to the calculation modules that use location algorithms, segmentation plate and character recognition.
